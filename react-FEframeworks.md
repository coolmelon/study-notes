## Study notes about React, and other front-end frameworks

Before diving into learning front-end frameworks, i think its important to take time to learn basics of JavaScript (ES6+), HTML & CSS first. Especially JavaScript, it will be foundation knowledge of front-end learning.  

## React 

#### Learning React
Reference links:

 * [Build your own react](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) -- good website to learn concepts of React code bases.

#### Style Guide

 * In my code editor VScode, I use extensions: ESlint, Prettier, JavaScript(ES6) code snippets, ES7 React/Redex/GraphQL/React-Native snippets, Reactjs code snippets , that I think helps a lot for good coding formats & practices.
