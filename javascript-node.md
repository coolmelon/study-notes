# Study notes and resources for JavaScript and Node.js


### Algorithm and data structure

Books I like: 
 * Good introduction book:  Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People, by by Aditya Bhargava

Videos: 
 * Fun video to watch, "Quick-sort Dance", you can find they have other sorting dance online as well, [YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWBy6J5gz8) 

### Style Guide

In my code editor VScode, I use extensions: ESlint, Prettier, JavaScript(ES6) code snippets, that I think helps a lot for good coding formats & practices.
